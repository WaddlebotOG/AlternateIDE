I didn't choose any of the ones I didn't like. So pretty much all of them. The only one I am used to beyond a doubt is Eclipse. I've been using it since my Junior year 
of high school. I plan to continue using it throughout my Senior year, specifically, for this class. I didn't feel comfortable to use a completely different IDE that
I was unfamiliar with.
